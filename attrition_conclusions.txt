### Key Findings from IBM HR Attrition Analysis

1. **Overall Attrition Rate**: 16.12% of employees left the company. (~1 in 6 employees)
2. **Average Tenure**: Employees stayed for an average of 7.0 years before leaving.
3. **Age Factor**: Younger employees (<30) show higher attrition compared to older groups.
4. **Gender Factor**: Attrition slightly higher among males than females.
5. **Department Factor**: Sales shows the highest attrition, R&D lower, HR moderate.
6. **Income Factor**: Employees with lower monthly income are more likely to leave.

### Conclusions

- Attrition is moderate but concerning, with 16% turnover.  
- Early-career employees and Sales staff are at higher risk.  
- Low salary, high workload (travel), and poor work-life balance are strong drivers.  
- Stronger retention programs, fair pay, and work-life initiatives can reduce attrition.
